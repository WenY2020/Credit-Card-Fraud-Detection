# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## How to detect credit card fraud by Machine Learning algorithms?

 The project aim is to develop models to predict the new transaction is fraud or not with knowing some features of the transaction.
 
 Two Machine Learning algorithms are used in this project: Deep Neural Network and Random Forest.
 
### 1. Import data 
### 2. Data Understanding: e.g. definition, correlation, visualization
### 3. Data Prepration: e.g. Feature engineering
### 4. Data Modelling: 
### 5. Model Evaluation:
