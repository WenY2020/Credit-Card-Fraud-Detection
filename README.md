# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

How to detect credit card fraud by Machine Learning algorithms?

 The project aim is to develop a model to predict the new transaction is fraud or not with some features of the transaction known.
 
 Two algorithms are used in this project: Deep Neural Network and Random Forest
